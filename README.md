# Healthcare Application - DevOps Challenge

A comprehensive DevOps solution demonstrating Infrastructure as Code, containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud deployment using AWS Fargate.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project implements a microservices architecture with two Node.js services deployed on AWS Fargate:

- **Patient Service**: Manages patient data and records
- **Appointment Service**: Handles appointment scheduling and management

### Key Components
- **AWS Fargate**: Serverless container platform
- **Application Load Balancer**: Traffic distribution and path-based routing
- **Amazon ECR**: Container image registry
- **VPC**: Network isolation with public/private subnets
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring, logging, and dashboards
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- GitHub repository with secrets configured
- Docker (for local development)
- AWS CLI v2
- Terraform >= 1.6.0

### 1. Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
# Push changes to main branch to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

### 2. Access Application
```bash
# Get the ALB DNS name from Terraform outputs
terraform output alb_dns_name

# Test the services
curl http://<alb-dns-name>/api/patients
curl http://<alb-dns-name>/api/appointments
```

## 🔧 Infrastructure Modules

### VPC Module
- Multi-AZ VPC with public/private subnets
- NAT Gateways for outbound internet access
- Security groups for network isolation
- Route tables and internet gateway

### ECS Module
- Fargate cluster with container insights
- Task definitions with health checks
- Services with auto-scaling capabilities
- Integration with load balancer target groups

### ALB Module
- Application Load Balancer with path-based routing
- Target groups with health checks
- Security groups for HTTP/HTTPS traffic

### ECR Module
- Container repositories for each service
- Lifecycle policies for image management
- Image vulnerability scanning enabled

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipelines

### Infrastructure Pipeline
1. **Validate**: Terraform format check and validation
2. **Plan**: Generate execution plan on pull requests
3. **Apply**: Deploy infrastructure on main branch merge

### Application Pipeline
1. **Build**: Create Docker images and push to ECR
2. **Deploy**: Update ECS services with new images
3. **Monitor**: Wait for deployment stabilization

## 📊 Monitoring

### CloudWatch Integration
- **Container Insights**: ECS cluster monitoring
- **Log Groups**: Centralized application logging
- **Dashboards**: Custom metrics visualization
- **Alarms**: CPU utilization alerts

### Health Checks
- **Application**: `/health` endpoint for each service
- **Load Balancer**: Automatic target health monitoring
- **Container**: Built-in Docker health checks

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Network Isolation**: Services in private subnets
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access principles
- **Security Groups**: Restricted network access
- **Container Security**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit

## 📖 API Documentation

### Patient Service (`/api/patients`)
```bash
# Create patient
curl -X POST http://<alb-dns>/api/patients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com"}'

# Get all patients
curl http://<alb-dns>/api/patients

# Get patient by ID
curl http://<alb-dns>/api/patients/<patient-id>
```

### Appointment Service (`/api/appointments`)
```bash
# Create appointment
curl -X POST http://<alb-dns>/api/appointments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "patientId":"<patient-id>",
    "doctorName":"Dr. Smith",
    "appointmentDate":"2024-02-01",
    "appointmentTime":"10:00"
  }'

# Get all appointments
curl http://<alb-dns>/api/appointments
```

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Running Services Locally
```bash
# Patient Service
cd microservices/patient-service
npm install
npm run dev

# Appointment Service
cd microservices/appointment-service
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Building Docker Images
```bash
# Patient Service
cd microservices/patient-service
docker build -t patient-service .

# Appointment Service
cd microservices/appointment-service
docker build -t appointment-service .
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Deployment Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check ECS service status
   aws ecs describe-services --cluster healthcare-app-dev-cluster --services healthcare-app-dev-patient-service
   ```

2. **Container Health Check Failures**
   ```bash
   # View application logs
   aws logs tail /ecs/healthcare-app-dev/patient-service --follow
   ```

3. **Load Balancer Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check target group health
   aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <target-group-arn>
   ```
