# Security Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in the Healthcare Application infrastructure.

## Security Tools Integration

### TFLint
- **Purpose**: Terraform linting and best practices validation
- **Configuration**: `.tflint.hcl`
- **Checks**: AWS-specific rules, naming conventions, deprecated syntax

### Checkov
- **Purpose**: Infrastructure security scanning
- **Configuration**: `.checkov.yml`
- **Scans**: Security misconfigurations, compliance violations, best practices

## Security Measures

### Network Security
- **VPC Isolation**: Private subnets for application workloads
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive ingress/egress rules
- **NAT Gateways**: Controlled outbound internet access

### Container Security
- **Non-root User**: Containers run as non-privileged user
- **Image Scanning**: ECR vulnerability scanning enabled
- **Minimal Base Images**: Alpine Linux for reduced attack surface

### Access Control
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege principle
- **Task Roles**: Service-specific permissions
- **Execution Roles**: Minimal ECS task execution permissions

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: S3 state bucket encryption
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables for configuration

## Compliance Checks

### Automated Security Scanning
- Runs on every pull request
- Blocks deployment on critical security issues
- Provides detailed security reports

### Security Policies
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Regular security updates for base images
- Monitoring and alerting for security events

## Security Monitoring

### CloudWatch Integration
- Security-related log monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- Automated alerting for security events

### Best Practices
- Regular security assessments
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Infrastructure security reviews
